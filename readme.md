#NHibernate Mapping Spike

I've been dealing with a really poorly design database schema recently, 
and I've flailed about for days trying to both learn NHibernate AND map this database. 
I finally think I have enough knownledge of both the system and NH to be able to map it now. 
This represents my solution. Feedback is welcome!

Just about everything you need is included. You will need to install System.Data.SQLite (I know, I really should include this). You can grab a copy of [System.Data.SQLite] (http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/) if you need it.
